Built an interactive Cognos Analytics dashboard to analyze performance metrics for a regional car dealership group.

This lab was part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, focused on developing hands-on skills in data visualization and business intelligence using IBM Cognos Analytics.
The scenario simulated the role of a Regional Manager responsible for monitoring sales and service performance across multiple dealerships.
