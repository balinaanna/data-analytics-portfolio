# Anna Stupachenko (Balina) - Data Analytics Portfolio

##### Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! Thanks for stopping by 👋

Driven by curiosity, I'm combining my background in **full-stack software engineering** with **analytical and visualization techniques** to explore how data storytelling can bridge technology, design, and human impact.  
This portfolio is a **work in progress** - I'm continuously learning, experimenting, and expanding it through real-world data projects.
